## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This is a Doordash clone for specifically Mcdonald's Delivery and Takeout. It is only a static page with working cart and and checkout functionality. It can be a good starting point for a restaraunt menu page. Please feel free clone the repo and use as needed. I am not affiliated with Doordash in anyway.
